## Algorithms visualizer
The purpose of this repository is create a visualisation to how some algorithms works.
The project has two versions the v1.0 the languege that I use to code the logic was JavaScript,
but in v2.0 all the JavaScript was migrated for `TypeScript ^3.7.2`, with npm modules.

The language of the scripts is JavaScript and the libs that I'm using is `JQuery 3.4.1` and `Bootstrap 4.3.1`
 
You can test the "web aplication" on the link bellow:
